<h1>Best Practices Seminar</h1>

Sharing best practices in modeling and software development.

<h4>Highlights from 4/1/2020 Discussion</h4>

Modeling Best Practices 

* Software design (RM)
* Interfacing codes:  one big advantage of IDEAS is linkages and the training would be to connect the interface design from a domain perspective (what needs to be passed to connect the physics)  with the software engineering perspective (how best to set up this interface, minimizing overhead and maximizing performance).  I think discussions focused there might be really helpful.  We could start with more generic training on this from a software point of view and focus on a specific example from one of the IDEAS ecosystem of codes. (RM)
* Papers & Case studies breakdown (SM)
  - Share finished pieces of work, new research that will spawn topics that others want to learn
* Modeling, tools, hands-on format (SM)
* What are you working on roundtable (AF)
* Workflow because things are changing, documentation (DD)
* Modeling coupling strategies / interfaces (KF)
* Learn new tools & software (modeling tools e.g. ParFlow, make modeling more efficient, how to run in parallel, how to debug in a large model) (JZ)
* PNNL workflow (ZX)
* LBNL workflow (ZX)
* Workflows spanning across models, e.g., met forcing developed through ParFlow simulations as inputs to ATS. (ZX)
* Interest in learning about process studies from other projects, e.g., snow, ice, etc. (ZX)
* Tutorial & introduction on Parameter estimation, data assimilation (XC)
* AI (XC)
* Workflow - what does workflow mean to you, workflow management, best practices, how to maintain workflow in a community (XC)

Software Best Practices

* Develop/use git repos for the partnership use cases as a means of sharing and training here (DM)
* Python notebooks vs python code for workflows, how to balance. (DM)
* What languages and tools would fit into reproducible workflows (DM)
equency make most sense
* CMAKE seminar would be to interest to many, especially in relation to the codes in the ecosystem, like ATS/Amanzi or Parflow (SM)
* Interest in tips on parallel debugging and profiling (things broad enough to be applicable to most / all codes of interest) (KF)
Also interested in tools and strategies for documentation (KF)

Other

* Short bios for the team to make it easier to find people/ match up with needs
* Onboarding documents - quick overview (SR)
